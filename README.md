A overhaul of the original game, adding tons of units, 2 more planets, and more resources

## Planets
Mindustry++ adds 2 more planets: Eutis and Xovis. New resources will be introduced on the planets, resources not avaliable on Seruplo.

## New Resources
Mindustry++ introduces more resources, such as Iron, Uranium, Diamond, and more. It will also introduce the corresponding factories: Uranium Refinery, Iron Smelter, and Diamond Cutter. Diamonds and Uranium are rare resources and are only found in small patches. Iron is plentiful and is essential to higher tier blocks and units.

## Extended Tech Tree and Campaign
Mindustry++ adds more tech tree branches and allows the player to extend the campaign to other planets after the Interplanetary Launcher block is unlocked.

## New Weapons
- Cosmonus: Shoots a powerful orb that can deal huge damage on buildings and group enemies.
- Voldium: Good for air units. Shoots homing laser and explodes on impact.
- Galactum: Fires a small beams but has a very fast fire rate.
- Groundbreaker: Fires a large beam that can burn and deals a lot of damage.
- Orbital Strike: Calls in a missle strike to your current location/selected location, however, a array of sattellites are required to use this function
