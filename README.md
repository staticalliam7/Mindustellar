A overhaul of the original game, adding tons of content and 2 more planets
## Harder campaign.
This is where the fun begins. A units now must be fueled using **Refueling Stations**. Fuel can be manufactured using oil and a **Fuel refinery**. Spores can be used as an alternate fuel source, at the cost of reduced efficiency. Also, harder bosses. All parts now heat to a certain degree, This can be solved by using **Radiator Panels**. Most low-tier blocks can heat safely (at a lower efficiency), however, higher tier blocks can, and will, cause damage to surronding blocks due to overheating.

## Planets
Mindustry++ adds 2 more planets: Eutis and Xovis. New resources will be introduced on the planets, resources not avaliable on Seruplo.


## Extended Tech Tree and Campaign
Mindustry++ adds more tech tree branches and allows the player to extend the campaign to other planets after the Interplanetary Launcher block is unlocked.

## Full documentation will be in wiki

# Features I will NOT be Adding
- **Anything that is cheaty.** This includes OP turrets. If you want to cheat, there are plenty of mods, such as [Hackdustry](https://github.com/Gdeft/hackdustry)
- **Stacked blocks.** I'm not doing this, nor is Anuke. If you really want this implemented, make your own mod.
- **Units carrying other units.** Honestly, there's no point. Fuel is gonna be an issue either way.
- **Retexturing of stock assets.** I don't really care, and the default textures are fine. This is meant to be a mod, not a texture pack. If you want different textures, I highy suggest [Factoriodustry](https://github.com/Xeloboyo/Factoriodustry).
- **Longer range mass drivers.** Normal mass drivers are overpowered enough. Again, if you really want it, make a mod.
- **Easy mode.** This mod is designed to add more challenge to the game. If you don't like the difficulty of it, don't play it. 
- **Recomposing game music.** Honestly, the game's soundtrack is a work of art. Once again, if you really want it, make a mod.
- **Moons.** I would actually love to do this, however the game currently does not support this. If you can find a workaround, please notify me.




Oh, you read this far? Have a cookie.
Also, welcome. I'm back from my very long unplanned hiatus (aka me forgetting this exists)
