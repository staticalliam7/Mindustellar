# Mindustellar
***Please note that this mod is still in development and may be broken, missing features, missing sprites, or completely unplayable***

## Important for contributors:

[Features I will not be adding](README.md#features-i-will-not-be-adding)




## Harder campaign.
This is where the fun begins. All units now must be fueled using **Refueling Stations**. Fuel can be manufactured using oil and a **Fuel refinery**. Spores can be used as an alternate fuel source, at the cost of reduced efficiency. Also, harder bosses. All parts now heat to a certain degree, This can be solved by using **Radiator Panels**. Most low-tier blocks can heat safely (at a lower efficiency), however, higher tier blocks can, and will, cause damage to surronding blocks due to overheating.

## Planets
good lord bless your heart this mod adds a lot of celestial bodies. over 15.





## Full documentation will be in wiki

# Features I will NOT be Adding
- **Anything that is cheaty.** This includes OP turrets. If you want to cheat, there are plenty of mods, such as [Hackdustry](https://github.com/Gdeft/hackdustry)
- **Stacked blocks.** I'm not doing this, nor is Anuke. If you really want this implemented, make your own mod.
- **Retexturing of stock assets.** I don't really care, and the default textures are fine. This is meant to be a mod, not a texture pack. If you want different textures, I highy suggest [Factoriodustry](https://github.com/Xeloboyo/Factoriodustry). (or [amogus](https://github.com/staticalliam7/amogus/))
- **Longer range mass drivers.** Normal mass drivers are overpowered enough. Again, if you really want it, make a mod.
- **Easy mode.** This mod is designed to add more challenge to the game. If you don't like the difficulty of it, don't play it.
