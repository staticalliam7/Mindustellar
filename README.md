A overhaul of the original game, adding tons of content and 2 more planets
## Harder campaign.
This is where the fun begins. A units now must be fueled using **Refueling Stations**. Fuel can be manufactured using oil and a **Fuel refinery**. Spores can be used as an alternate fuel source, at the cost of reduced efficiency. Also, harder bosses. All parts now heat to a certain degree, This can be solved by using **Radiator Panels**. Most low-tier blocks can heat safely (at a lower efficiency), however, higher tier blocks can, and will, cause damage to surronding blocks due to overheating.

## Planets
Mindustry++ adds 2 more planets: Eutis and Xovis. New resources will be introduced on the planets, resources not avaliable on Seruplo.

## New Resources
Mindustry++ introduces more resources, such as Iron, Uranium, Diamond, and more. It will also introduce the corresponding factories: Uranium Refinery, Iron Smelter, and Diamond Cutter. Diamonds and Uranium are rare resources and are only found in small patches. Iron is plentiful and is essential to higher tier blocks and units.

## Extended Tech Tree and Campaign
Mindustry++ adds more tech tree branches and allows the player to extend the campaign to other planets after the Interplanetary Launcher block is unlocked.

## New Weapons
- Cosmonus: Shoots a powerful orb that can deal huge damage on buildings and group enemies.
- Voldium: Good for air units. Shoots homing laser and explodes on impact.
- Galactum: Fires a small beams but has a very fast fire rate.
- Groundbreaker: Fires a large beam that can burn and deals a lot of damage.
- Orbital Strike: Calls in a missle strike to your current location/selected location, however, a array of sattellites are required to use this function

## Infastructure
### Sattellites
Sattellites are required to support things like Orbital Strike, Survey Scanners, and Orbital Laser Drill.

### Survey Scanners
Survey Scanners are used to determine resources on a undiscovered sector, as these details are not shown.



# Features I will NOT be Adding
- **Anything that is cheaty.** This includes OP turrets. If you want to cheat, there are plenty of mods, such as [Hackdustry](https://github.com/Gdeft/hackdustry)
- **Stacked blocks.** I'm not doing this, nor is Anuke. If you really want this implemented, make your own mod.
- **Units carrying other units.** Honestly, there's no point. Fuel is gonna be an issue either way.
- **Retexturing of stock assets.** I don't really care, and the default textures are fine. This is meant to be a mod, not a texture pack. If you want different textures, I highy suggest [Factoriodustry](https://github.com/Xeloboyo/Factoriodustry).
- **Longer range mass drivers.** Normal mass drivers are overpowered enough. Again, if you really want it, make a mod.
- **Easy mode.** This mod is designed to add more challenge to the game. If you don't like the difficulty of it, don't play it. 
- **Recomposing game music.** Honestly, the game's soundtrack is a work of art. Once again, if you really want it, make a mod.
- **Moons.** I would actually love to do this, however the game currently does not support this. If you can find a workaround, please notify me.




Oh, you read this far? Have a cookie.
Also, welcome. I'm back from my very long unplanned hiatus (aka me forgetting this exists)
